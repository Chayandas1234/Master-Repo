//bitwise operator
/*
 * It is same as And operator
 * 0000 1010
 * 0000 0110
 * so the and bitwize operator will be  ie "&"
 * 0000 0010 <--
 * if two bit are diff in the same position then it would be zero other wise one  Zero ko priority milege
 *
 * 
 * NOW or bit wise operator "|"
 * 0000 1010
 * 0000 0110
 * 0000 1110 <--
 * This is or bit wise operation
 * 
 * 
 * Now XOR bit wise operator ie  "^"
 * so the one one will become zero and rest is same as or operator
 * 0000 1010
 * 0000 0110
 * 0000 1100 <--
 * 
 * 
 * now next is NOT operator it will just flip all the bits ~
 * 0000 1010 --> 1111 0101
 * 
 * 
 * now next two is left shift and right shift 
 * 0000 1010 --> (one left shift)-->0001 0100 this is it*/

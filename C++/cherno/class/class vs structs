struct ==structure
vs 
class

whean you should be using a struct and when to use a class??

so the diff is 

major ones = none 
but there is one to do with the visibility

so a class is pvt by default so if you dont specify anything it will  be considered private

howerer with a struct it is default public; 

but the main reason why struct is still used is because of its backward compatibility with c because c does not have classes it has structures ie struck but you can deal with that with just a simple 

                #define struct class//this simplly means that wherever there is a struck just replace it with the word class with the functionality of struct instead

so in the end it just boils down to the user preference!!!

===
inside the class
outside the class

inside the class:-
static gona share the memory with all the instances that you create of class or struct there is only gooing to be only one instance of that static vaiable and similar things applies to static method in a class there is no instance of that class being passed into the method and it will be in done in the future


outside the class:-
